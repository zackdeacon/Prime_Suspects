USER STORY 
AS A shopper who wants to buy electronics online, I WANT to have a secure website, where I can CREATE a User Profile, login in, Shop and ADD items to my cart all on my mobile device. SO THAT I can shop anywhere

GIVEN I am shopping, When I add things to the cart, Then they should remain in the cart until I remove them or checkout.

WHEN I forget to ADD something to my Cart, I WANT to be able to continue shopping, THEN not lose my carts contents.  

WHEN I search for specific items, THEN I am presented with those items. When I want to checkout, Then I hit the checkout button and am able to pay with my credit card on a secure page. 

For this app, we created secure API routes and used STRIPE to meet these goals. We populated our merchendise using a data set, which we quieried in our database using mySQL. We used Materialize for the layout design.
